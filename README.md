# Web Development Repository

This repository contains a collection of projects related to web development, demonstrating various techniques and concepts across front-end and back-end development. These projects encompass a wide range of functionalities, from interactive personal portfolios to dynamic forms, timers, and PHP-based data storage solutions. Below are descriptions of each project included in the repository:

1. **Interactive Personal Portfolio for Academic Showcase**  
   This project features an interactive portfolio website designed to showcase academic achievements, projects, and skills. It includes responsive design principles, interactive elements, and detailed sections for academic work.

2. **By2coffee**  
   By2coffee is a web-based platform designed for users to explore coffee varieties, their origins, and brewing methods. The site includes dynamic content, user interaction features, and a visually appealing layout to engage users interested in coffee culture.

3. **Workshop Registration Website**  
   This project consists of a website for workshop registration, featuring form elements for capturing user details, including workshop preferences, food choices, and accommodation preferences. It uses HTML5 form elements, validation through JavaScript, and basic styling to provide a smooth user experience.

4. **Student Registration Form**  
   A student registration form designed to capture important details, such as name, age, city, food preferences, and other essential data for event registration. The form includes validation using JavaScript to ensure correct data entry.

5. **Session Entry Counter**  
   This project demonstrates a session room entry counter. It uses JavaScript to increment counters for males and females entering a session room. Buttons are provided for manual entry, and the total number of participants is displayed dynamically.

6. **ToDo List Application**  
   A simple To-Do List web application where users can add, remove, and manage tasks. JavaScript is used to handle event listeners for adding and removing list items, providing an interactive user experience.

7. **Countdown Timer**  
   This project implements a countdown timer with start, pause, resume, and reset functionalities. Users can input a duration, and JavaScript controls the timerâ€™s operation, updating the remaining time every second.

8. **Data Passing Example**  
   A simple demonstration of passing data between two pages using both GET and POST methods in HTML forms. This project captures user input (e.g., roll number, name, email) and displays it on a second page.

9. **PHP Website Demo**  
   This project showcases a PHP-based website that demonstrates cookie storage, session management, basic file operations, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using MySQL.

10. **Book Catalog XML to HTML**  
    This project involves creating an XML catalog of books and then transforming the XML content into an HTML file using PHP. The project demonstrates how to work with XML files, extract data, and display it in an organized HTML format.
